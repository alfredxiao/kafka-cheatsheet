stores group password


- Group passwords, if set, allow user accounts access to groups to whom they do not belong. If a group password is used, this password is typically shared among the various users who need access to the group. This is a bad security practice. Passwords should never be shared. Each account needs to have its own password, and access to groups should be allowed only via group membership, not group passwords.
