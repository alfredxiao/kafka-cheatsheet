- The environment must be set to whatever is necessary for a given user because cron does not provide an environment of any kind.
- The `SHELL` variable specifies the shell to use when commands are executed. This example specifies the Bash shell.
- The `MAILTO` variable sets the email address where cron job results will be sent.
- The third line sets up the `PATH` for the environment.
