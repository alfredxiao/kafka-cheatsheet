- The CUPS web interface allows you to define new printers, modify existing printers, and check on the status of print jobs sent to each printer. Not only does CUPS recognize directly connected printers, but you can also configure network printers using several standard network printing protocols, such as the `Internet Printing Protocol` (`IPP`) or the Microsoft `Server Message Block` (`SMB`) protocol.
