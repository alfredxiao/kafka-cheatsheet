* `su - user2`
* `usermod -L user1` lock a user's password

  * `usermod -s /sbin/nologin user1` to disallow login shell
* `usermod -U -e "" user1` unlock a user's password and account

# Change login name
- `usermod -l new_name old_name`
* When a user is already logged in, you can't change login name
* Other changes won't be available until user re-login
- **note** this command does not change home directory

# Change primary group
- `usermod -g newprimary user1`

# add a supplementary group:
- `usermod -aG newgroupname username`

# Change user home
- `usermod -d /home/newhome user1`

* Change UID is dangerous as it makes existing files orphaned
* Lock a user: `usermod -L auser`
* Unlock a user: `usermod -U auser`
