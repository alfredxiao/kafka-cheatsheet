binmail
The name binmail comes from its typical location on the system, /bin/mail (or /usr/bin/mail).

The binmail program became popular because of its simplicity. By default, it can read email messages stored in the /var/spool/mail/ directory, or you can provide command- line options to point to the user’s $HOME/mail file. No configuration is required for binmail to do its job.

If you’d like to follow along with using the binmail program, you may need to install it on your Linux distribution. For Ubuntu, the package name is `bsd-mailx`, and for CentOS, though it is typically installed by default, the package name is `mailx`.
