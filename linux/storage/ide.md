# Basics
- IDE = Integrated Drive Electronics
- IDE is a standard interface that allows storage devices to connect to and communicate with the motherboard of a computer
- The controller is built into the drive rather than having a dedicated controller on the motherboard (this is why the term 'integrated' in IDE)
- IDE is kind of synonym of 'PATA'
