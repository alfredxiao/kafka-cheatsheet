The kube-scheduler uses an algorithm to determine which node will host a Pod of containers. The scheduler will try to view available resources (such as available CPU) to bind, and then assign the Pod based on availability and success. The scheduler uses pod-count by default, but complex configuration is often done if cluster-wide metrics are collected.

There are several ways you can affect the algorithm, or a custom scheduler could be used simultaneously instead. A Pod can also be assigned bind to a particular node in the pod spec, though the Pod may remain in a pending state if the node or other declared resource is unavailable.

One of the first configurations referenced during creation is if the Pod can be deployed within the current quota restrictions. If so, then the taints and tolerations, and labels of the Pods are used along with those of the nodes to determine the proper placement. Some is done as an admission controller in the kube-apiserver, the rest is done by the chosen scheduler.
