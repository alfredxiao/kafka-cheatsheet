The kube-controller-manager is a core control loop daemon which interacts with the kube-apiserver to determine the state of the cluster. If the state does not match, the manager will contact the necessary controller to match the desired state. There are several controllers in use, such as endpoints, namespace, and replication. The full list has expanded as Kubernetes has matured.

Remaining in beta as of v1.16, the cloud-controller-manager interacts with agents outside of the cloud. It handles tasks once handled by kube-controller-manager. This allows faster changes without altering the core Kubernetes control process. Each kubelet must use the --cloud-provider-external settings passed to the binary.
